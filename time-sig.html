            <p>
                Time signatures are how we keep time and tell how long we hold on to a note. 
                We'll be going over note values and the the 3 main time signatures.

            <h2>Note Values</h2>

            <p>There are a total of 7 diffrent note vales. 
                Today you'll be learning the basic 4 notes and rest with the basic extras.
            </p> 

            <h3>Measures</h3>
            <p>
                To tell how long a note is you'll see vertical lines seperating some of the notes. 
                This is called a mesure and helps keeps time as you'll understand better at the end of this lesson. 
                this goes in hand and hand with time signatures which are the numbers that are infront of every 
                piece of music. 
            </p>

            <h3>Types Of Notes</h3>
            <p>
              first you have a whole note and rest. These take up the whole measure and typically take up 4 beats.  
            </p>

            <p>
              Next is half notes and rest. These typicly take up 2 beats or half the mesure
            </p>

            <p>
              Then quarter notes and rest. These are the most common and take one beat. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Then we have 8th notes and rest that take up an half of a beat. These usaly end on the beat and the ands.
            </p>

            <p>As you can see the common theme is dividing the note 8. From this point we have 
              16th notes, 32nd notes, 64 notes and so on. Starting out you won't see these types of notes but you will the more
              advance you get!

            <h2>Special Add Ons</h2>

            <h3>Dotted Notes</h3>
            <p>
              Now for the extras 
              First you'll see with notes is a dot NEXT to the note or rest. 
              This means that you hold it for a half of a beat longer than the note its attached to. 
              So a dot next to a half note would be 3 beats and a dot next to a quarter note would be a beat and a half. 
            </p>

            <h3>Slurs</h3>
            <p>
              next is the line over two lines. This is called a slur.
               A slur is when you play it without seperating the notes. 
               So if there are two quarter notes slured together that are the same it acts like a half note. 
               if the notes are diffrent under a slur then you don't strum or toung the notes. 
            </p>

            <h3>Triplets</h3>
            <p>
              Next is a 3 under 3 notes. 
              Through out music you'll see diffrent variations of these. 
              This one in particular is called a triplet and you count it literly as
              <b>" Trip- a - la" </b> the first note get's the Tip, second a and third la.

            <h2>4/4</h2>
            <p>
              4/4 is the most common time signature thus the name common time. 
              This means that every mesure has 4 beats. This means that a 
              whole note gets 4 beats, half notes get 2 beats, quarter notes get 1 
              and so on.

            <h2>3/4</h2>
            <p>
              3/4 is the most common time signature 
              whenever you listen to a walts or something along 
              that line. In 3/4 it's a bit tricky because everything is 
              slighly diffrent values. A whole note is 3 beats because 
              thats how many beats there are in a mesure. A half note is 
              a beat and a half. The quarter notes stay the same but it 
              helps give the feel of the music.

          <div class="column">
            <h2>2/4</h2>
            <p>
              2/4 time is everything half of 4/4 and thus why it's also known as cut time.
              Every mesre gets 2 beats. In this a whole note would get 2 beats, half note 2 and 
              a quarter note would equal 1 , and a 8th note would qual a 4th of the beat . 
              very simular to the 4/4 time but it tends to be faster.
